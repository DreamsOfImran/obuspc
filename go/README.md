# Go API Server for swagger

This is the REST API for the User Services Platform (USP) Controller.  This is how an external entity can interact with a USP Controller to retrieve information from or configure a USP Agent.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen]
(https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.
